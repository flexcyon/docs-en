Adds a repeating pattern of rhombi to your editor background. Rotation can be adjusted.

```md
cssclasses:
    - editor-rhombus
---

Your content will render as usual
```

## Callout metadata provider

There is also a callout metadata provider for rhombus background (which works in
live preview and reading mode)

```md
>[!note|bg-rhombus] I will display as usual
> I will have a rhombus background
```
