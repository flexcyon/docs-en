# Foreword

The Easter Egg6mode existed in `flexcyon` theme from 12 April 2025 to late May
2025. It was deprecated due to a lack of interest.

## Rules

1. Enable Easter Egg mode in Style Settings to start.
2. Total of 5 challenges to uncover. Once a challenge is done, it will provide a
hint to the next challenge at the bottom right of the screen in Obsidian
(outside of source mode).
3. As I cannot and will not obsfucate the source code. Please do not clone the
repository and search up for the answers :)
4. The first 5 to DM me on Discord (user `@data_in_void`) with the full set of
hints and their corresponding answers (in correct order) for each of the
challenges will get a shoutout in the README and documentation.

The hint for the first challenge is: colors of pi. Good luck!
