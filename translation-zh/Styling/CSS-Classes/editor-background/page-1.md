# Usage

Adds repeating dots to your editor background. Size can be adjusted in style settings.

```md
cssclasses:
    - editor-dots
---

Your content will render as usual
```

## Callout metadata provider

There is also a callout metadata provider for dotted background (which works in
live preview and reading mode)

```md
>[!note|bg-grid] I will display as usual
> I will have a dotted background
```
