A huge shout out to Daniel's [Halcyon theme](https://github.com/dbarenholz/halcyon-obsidian) and kepano's [flexoki](https://github.com/kepano/flexoki-obsidian) theme, both of which are under the MIT license.

In addition, the light mode colour scheme would not be possible without the great [Origami theme](https://github.com/7368697661/Origami) (which is also under the MIT License).
