# Roadmap

The roadmap will not be updated often. However, it represents some features I
wish to add but may be too time-consuming for me to handle.

## Misc

- Add better screenshots

> Add more CSS classes

### Plugins/snippets

- Support more plugins
  - Could also look at:
    - Tasks
    <!-- - Excalidraw (too difficult to style) -->
    - QuickAdd (override default css variables)
    - Vertical Tabs etc
- `publish.css`

### Other styling options

- Mermaid Chart Styling
<!-- - [ ] PDF export styling (class select). Not happening when it is 
impossible to debug -->
