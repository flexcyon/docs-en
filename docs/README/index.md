# About Flexcyon

A Obsidian theme combining the colour schemes of Halcyon and Flexoki.

I really liked the vibrant colours of the 
[Halcyon colour scheme](https://halcyon-theme.netlify.app/), and the inky
aesthetic of the [Flexoki colour scheme](https://stephango.com/flexoki).
Hence, I decided to combine the two which started this theme.
