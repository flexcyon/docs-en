# Roadmap

The roadmap will not be updated often. However, it represents some features I
wish to add but may be too time-consuming for me to handle.

## Misc

- Add better screenshots
- Light and dark mode with tested feature parity
- Adding more ASCII and clip path checkboxes
- Add more languages supported in documentation translation


### Plugins/snippets

- Support more plugins
  - Could also look at:
    - Tasks
    - QuickAdd (override default css variables)
    - Vertical Tabs etc
- `publish.css`

### Other styling options

- PDF export Styling
