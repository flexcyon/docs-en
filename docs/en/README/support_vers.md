# Supported Versions

Flexcyon's contributors takes version support very seriously.

Flexcyon is officially supported from [Obsidian Version 1.6.3](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2024-06-08-desktop-v1.6.3/)
onwards.

[Obsidian 1.6](https://obsidian.md/changelog/2024-06-07-desktop-v1.6.2/) and above
was chosen to be the minimum version supported as support for RTL languages was
added then.

Beta or insider versions of Obsidian will not be officially supported, although
the theme should (hopefully) not break too much.
> If significant issues are found, do open an issue at the repository. I (bladeacer)
> will try to troubleshoot them once the beta or insider version of
> Obsidian has a public equivalent.
